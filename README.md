MiniDNS

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MiniDNS/minidns.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/MiniDNS/minidns)  [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/MiniDNS/minidns/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/MiniDNS/minidns)

MiniDNS is a minimal DNS client client library for Android and Java SE. It can parse most relevant resource records (A, AAAA, NS, SRV, â€¦) and is easy to use and extend. It also provides experimental support for DNSSEC and DANE.

**Notice:** DNSSEC/DANE support is *experimental* and has not yet undergo a security audit.
If you find the project useful and are able to provide the resources for a security audit, then please contact us.

This library is not intended to be used as a DNS server. You might want to
look into dnsjava for such functionality.

Quickstart
----------

The easiest way to use MiniDNS is by its high-level API provided by the minidns-hla Maven artifact. Simply add the artifact to your projects dependencies. For example with gradle

```groovy
compile "de.measite.minidns:minidns-hla:$minidnsVersion"
```

Then you can use the `ResolverApi` class to perform DNS lookups and check if the result was authenticated via DNSSEC. The following example shows a lookup of A records of 'verteiltesysteme.net'.

```java
ResolverResult<A> result = ResolverApi.DNSSEC.resolve("verteiltesysteme.net", A.class);
if (!result.wasSuccessful()) {
	RESPONSE_CODE responseCode = result.getResponseCode();
	// Perform error handling.
	return;
}
if (!result.isAuthenticData()) {
	// Response was not secured with DNSSEC.
	return;
}
Set<A> answers = result.getAnswers();
for (A a : answers) {
  InetAddress inetAddress = a.getInetAddress();
  // Do someting with the InetAddress, e.g. connect to.
  ...
}
```

REPL
----

MiniDNS comes with a REPL which can be used to perform DNS lookups and to test the library. Simple use `./repl` to start the REPL. The loaded REPL comes with some predefined variables that you can use to perform lookups. For example `c` is a simple DNS client. See `minidns-repl/scala.repl` for more.

```text
minidns $ ./repl
...
scala> c.query("measite.de", TYPE.A)
res4: de.measite.minidns.DNSMessage = DNSMessage@54653(QUERY NO_ERROR qr rd ra) { \
  [Q: measite.de.	IN	A] \
  [A: measite.de.	3599	IN	A	85.10.226.249] \
  [X: EDNS: version: 0, flags:; udp: 512]
}
```
